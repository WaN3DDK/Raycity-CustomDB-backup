# Raycity-CustomDB-backup
 Forked from THunterTK(also known as Daily), my own backup files of databases, worked with Raycity 1.580 servers.
 
May works with MSSQL 2008, but I build this database with MSSQL 2017.
## Changes

- LegendCarlevel error fixed.
- Some grammars are edited to read more easily.
- Fix / Add some strings used in client(which starts with !sb)
- Some Cars and Items Tables are added in GameDefinition database - from KOR client 1.325 version.
- Can run Auctionagent(AA), MessengerAgent(MA), RaceAgent(RA), but may not work.(Not checked)

## TODO
